## Introduction 
<a id="Introduction"></a>

EdVenture is an educational utility application designed to address the
challenges of confusion and miscommunication between universities and
prospective students during the application and matriculation process.

Many institutions provide critical information through multiple different 
channels, such as personal and university email accounts,
student portals such as MyEd and Euclid. For students managing applications across several 
universities (particularly with systems like UCAS, where applicants
may apply to up to five Universities simultaneously), this inconsistency
creates unnecessary complexity and increases the risk of missed
communications.

EdVenture streamlines this process by centralizing university
correspondence into a single, intuitive platform, ensuring students
receive organized and easily accessible updates throughout
their academic transition.
